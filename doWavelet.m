% data is channels x time x trials
% samplingRate is the sampling rate of the data
% timePoints is the time vector for each sample
% baselineWindow are the start and end points of the baseline
% mortletParameter = 6 is normal, the range is from abour 3 to 8, the lower
% the value is the more temporal precision there is, the higher the number
% more frequency precision there is
% minimumFrequency is the lower bound of frequencies to examine
% maximumFrequency is the upper bound of frequencies to examine
% frequencySteps is the number of steps between the min and max frequencies

% get the data points for the baseline times (i.e., 1 50)
baseidx = baselineWindow;

% setup wavelet parameters

% frequency parameters
% the y-vector for plots showing the frequency range
frex = linspace(minimumFrequency,maximumFrequency,frequencySteps); % Linear scale
%frex = logspace(log10(min_freq),log10(max_freq),num_frex); % Log scale

% used in creating the actual wavelet
s = logspace(log10(mortletParameter(1)),log10(mortletParameter(end)),frequencySteps) ./ (2*pi*frex);

% length of the wavelet kernel, why -2 to 2??? WHY? MAYBE length of wavelet = 2 x
% sampling rate
wavtime = -2:1/samplingRate:2;

% middle of the wavelet - but also the length of the zero padding
half_wave = (length(wavtime)-1)/2;

% FFT parameters
% length of the wavelet
nWave = length(wavtime);

% length of data in the analysis when it is concatenated
nData = size(data,2) * size(data,3);

% this is the length of the convolution, data plus size of wavelet
nConv = nWave + nData - 1;

% cycle through the channels

    % processing speed (how much?)

        % now run convolution in one step - what is put into the fft is not the
        % dot the product of the EEG data and the wavelet, it is the dot
        % product of the fft of the EEG data and the wavelet - it is an inverse
        % fft as the two things going in are ffts already

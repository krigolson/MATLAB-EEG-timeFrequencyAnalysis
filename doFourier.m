    %   create a Hanning Window to reduce edge artifacts - divide by two to get
    %   half a cosine cycle - the discontinuity from edge artifacts is
    %   because the start and end voltages of the segment are different
    %   Mike Cohen says to turn off the Hanning Window

    % note, we are do not demean the data as in principle this is captured
    % at 0Hz which measures the DC offset. Further, if the data has been
    % filtered before FFT then the mean has already been removed.
    
    % added some varargin to allow for hamming, hanning, demean, and
    % upperbound, set the first varargin to 0 for no tapered window, to 1
    % for a hanning window, and to 2 for a hamming window. Set the second
    % varargin to 1 to demean the data or 0 to not do this. Finally, the
    % last varargin specifies the frequecy to chop the data at for cleanup
    % purposes.
